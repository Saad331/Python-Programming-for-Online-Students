    "    1) Class: class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state                     (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2)Object: objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are               eventually derived from the process. In between, each object is made into a generic class of object and even more               generic classes are defined so that objects can share models and reuse the class definitions in their code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3)Attributes: Attributes are an aspect of object oriented programming that are given a great deal of emphasis in  Python                    and some other object oriented languages. Each object oriented program uses a different method for determining                  attributes. (For instance, the compiler deduces these attributes from implicit or explicit declarations in the                  source code).  \n",
    "    4)Behavior: Behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do                     something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do                 anything to themselves or have anything done to them."
